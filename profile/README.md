<h3 align="center">VPNL: The Verifiable Performance Network Layer</h3>

<p align="center">
  <em>Building open reputation standards for provable performance across on-chain systems.</em><br>

</p>

---

### 🔷 Mission

**VPNL** is an open framework for **verifiable reputation and performance metrics**.  
It allows traders, solvers, and liquidity providers to prove their track records—privately, portably, and without trusted intermediaries.

We believe every reputation system should meet three conditions:

1. **Verifiable** – anyone can audit the proof of performance.  
2. **Portable** – a single identity can carry its history across protocols.  
3. **Privacy-preserving** – credentials reveal trustworthiness, not personal data.

VPNL turns performance data into a **universal proof layer for DeFi and AI-driven coordination**, starting with the Open Intents Framework.

### 🌐 What We’re Building

| Layer | Description | Example Use |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Registry Contracts** | On-chain modules for publishing verified performance proofs | Solvers in OIF networks |
| **Oracle Integration** | Decentralized data feeds via DIA Lumina | Trader and LP score aggregation |
| **Reputation Schema** | Cross-protocol scoring model (JSON + ZK-friendly) | “Proof of Alpha” for traders |
| **Verification Portal** | Public interface + SDK for submitting and verifying scores | Prop firms, DeFi protocols |

Each component is modular, open-source, and designed for integration into existing ecosystems like Uniswap v4, Hyperliquid, and AI coordination networks.

### 💠 Principles

> **Open metrics. Verifiable proof. Portable trust.**

- Built transparently, governed publicly.  
- MIT licensed to ensure freedom to fork and extend.  
- Rooted in collaboration with the Ethereum and DIA ecosystems.
